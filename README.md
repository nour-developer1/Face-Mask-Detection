# Face Mask Detection
My second task as Machine learning Engineer
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a face mask detection system using machine learning techniques.

The project aims to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, facilitating the enforcement of safety protocols and reducing the spread of infectious diseases

The face mask detection system is based on deep learning algorithms that are trained on a dataset of labeled images with and without masks. The model can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask in real-time video feeds or images.

### The system is built using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training the face mask detection model was collected from publicly available sources and augmented to include various scenarios and lighting conditions. The dataset contains thousands of images of people with and without masks and is balanced to ensure unbiased model training.
